# BLUX-Quantum

**Standalone CLI for AI Workflows**  
_Plug-in ready. Local-first. Blux-powered._

---

## 🚧 Project Status: Planning & Scaffolding 🚧

This is the future home of **BLUX-Quantum**—the standalone, open-source CLI for local and modular AI-powered automation, designed to work on its own or as a pluggable companion to [BLUX-cA](https://github.com/Justadudeinspace/blux-ca).

---

## **What is BLUX-Quantum?**

- A universal AI command line interface for creative, coding, and system automation workflows
- Works out of the box or as a plugin to BLUX-cA (the “hive mind” agent)
- Local-first: runs on your device, not in the cloud
- Fully modular—users can add agents, LLMs, scripts, and more

---

## **Planned Features**

- 🧑‍💻 One-command access to multiple AI engines and utilities
- ⚙️ Customizable workflows (compose prompts, code tasks, search, etc.)
- 🔌 Pluggable into BLUX-cA or usable standalone
- 💾 Works on desktop, laptop, and Android (via Termux)
- 🌱 Simple, ethical, and extensible
